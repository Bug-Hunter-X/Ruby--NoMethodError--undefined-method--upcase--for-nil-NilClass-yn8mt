This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Ruby: attempting to call a method on a `nil` object. The `bug.rb` file contains the erroneous code, resulting in a `NoMethodError`. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.rb`, addresses this using safe navigation or nil checking.  This is a frequent source of bugs, especially in methods receiving external input or during object initialization.
